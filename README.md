## Usage

FSP uses the [UserWrappr](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/UserWrappr) module to fill the available window size with a game screen, option menus, and piped input events.

```typescript
import { FullScreenPokemon } from "fullscreenpokemon";

const container = document.querySelector("#game");
const fsp = new FullScreenPokemon();

fsp.userWrapper.createDisplay(container);
```

You can make just the game canvas without any wrapping input pipes or menus by directly calling `FSP.reset(size)`.
The game will have a `.canvas` member displaying the game screen.
You'll need to set up your own event registrations manually.

```typescript
const fsp = new FullScreenPokemon();

fsp.reset(fsp.interface.sizes.GameBody);

document.body.appendChild(fsp.canvas);
```

## Development

```
git clone https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/FullScreenPokemon
cd FullScreenPokemon
npm run setup
npm run verify
```

* `npm run setup` creates a few auto-generated setup files locally.
* `npm run verify` builds, lints, and runs tests.

### Building

```shell
npm run watch
```

Source files are written under `src/` in TypeScript and compile in-place to JavaScript files.
`npm run watch` will directly run the TypeScript compiler on source files in watch mode.
Use it in the background while developing to keep the compiled files up-to-date.

### Running Tests

```shell
npm run test
```

Test files are alongside source files under `src/` and named `*.test.ts?`.
Whenever you add, remove, or rename a `*.test.ts?` file under `src/`, re-run `npm run test:setup` to regenerate the list of static test files in `test/index.html`.
You can open that file in a browser to debug through the tests.
`npm run test` will run that setup and execute tests using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).
