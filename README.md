## Usage

The built `src/index.html` uses [UserWrappr](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/UserWrappr) to fill the available window size with a game screen, option menus, and piped input events.
It stores its generated instance as `window.FSP`.

To do this in your own page, use the exported `createFspInterface` function.

```javascript
import { createFspInterface } from "fullscreenpokemon";

createFspInterface(document.getElementById("game"))
    .then(() => {
        console.log("Ready to play!");
        console.log(FSP);
    });
```

You can also directly create a new `FullScreenPokemon` instance with a manual size.

```javascript
import { FullScreenPokemon } from "fullscreenpokemon";

// Creates a new game with a 320x480 screen size
const fsp = new FullScreenPokemon({
    height: 320,
    width: 480,
});

// Games contain a .canvas member for the screen
document.body.appendChild(fsp.canvas);

// Shows the initial in-game menu with start and load options
fsp.gameplay.gameStart();
```

> By default, the game doesn't set up input events.
> You'll need to set up your own event registrations manually.

### Documentation

FSP is built on top of [GameStartr](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/GameStartr), a modular TypeScript game engine split across separate projects available on npm and hosted on GitHub in the [FullScreenShenanigans](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans) organization.
It consists of a couple dozen core modules under this organization.

See [./src/docs](https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/FullScreenPokemon/tree/master/docs) for documentation specific to FullScreenPokemon.

<!-- Development -->
## Development

After [forking the repo from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/):

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-name-here>/FullScreenPokemon
cd FullScreenPokemon
npm install
npm run setup
npm run verify
```

* `npm run setup` creates a few auto-generated setup files locally.
* `npm run verify` builds, lints, and runs tests.

### Building

```shell
npm run watch
```

Source files are written under `src/` in TypeScript and compile in-place to JavaScript files.
`npm run watch` will directly run the TypeScript compiler on source files in watch mode.
Use it in the background while developing to keep the compiled files up-to-date.

#### Running Tests

```shell
npm run test
```

Tests are written in [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai).
Their files are written using  alongside source files under `src/` and named `*.test.ts?`.
Whenever you add, remove, or rename a `*.test.t*` file under `src/`, `watch` will re-run `npm run test:setup` to regenerate the list of static test files in `test/index.html`.
You can open that file in a browser to debug through the tests.

<!-- Maps -->
#### Maps Tests

FullScreenPokemon includes automated tests in `src/Maps.test.ts` that loop over every map and location in the game.
That file is generated as part of `npm run setup`.
It creates a separate test group under `Maps` for each map, and a test for each of the map's locations.
